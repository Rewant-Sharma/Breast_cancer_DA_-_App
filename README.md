#Breast Cancer Prediction App#

#Overview#
The Breast Cancer Prediction App is a user-friendly web application designed to assist users in predicting whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, the app leverages a pre-trained artificial neural network model to provide accurate predictions based on user input.

#Features#

User Input:
The app allows users to enter measurements for specific features related to breast cancer. These features are selected based on their importance in predicting the outcome.

Prediction:
Once the user inputs the necessary measurements and clicks the "Predict" button, the app processes the input and provides a prediction indicating whether the breast mass is likely benign or malignant.

Probability Scores:
In addition to the prediction, the app displays the probability scores for both benign and malignant outcomes, offering insights into the model's confidence in its predictions.

Feature Importance:
The app highlights the most important features used in the prediction process, helping users understand which measurements contribute most significantly to the model's decision.
Educational Disclaimer: The app includes a disclaimer emphasizing that it is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice
